            One afternoon, as always, &emsp; was avoiding his homework, especially a boring history assignment.
           &emsp;&emsp; Doraemon, concerned, reminded him about the work. Nobita jokingly suggested they travel back in time to
            see history live instead of reading about it—and to his surprise, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Doraemon agreed. Using a special Time
            Machine Ticket, Doraemon took Nobita to ChronoCamp, a futuristic archaeological site where visitors could
            view ancient civilizations through safe, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;realistic holograms. They landed in the Lost City of Zanshara,
            a long-forgotten desert kingdom. There, an AI guide named Maya showed them around.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; But when a mysterious
            glitch appeared near the ruins, Nobita, curious as ever, stepped into a glowing portal and accidentally
            got transported into the real past, not the simulated one.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Now trapped in ancient Zanshara, Nobita had
            to survive in a world of real people, real danger, and mysterious legends. He met kind locals who mistook
            him for a "blue-eyed savior" from an old prophecy. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Things took a dramatic turn when a massive Golden
            Guardian statue came alive and started following him around the city.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; People believed Nobita was sent to
            save them from an oncoming disaster—a terrible sandstorm that threatened to bury the city forever.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            Nobita, terrified, had no idea how to help. Meanwhile, Doraemon worked frantically in the present to
            stabilize the time rift and rescue Nobita before time collapsed.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Eventually, Doraemon used the Anywhere
            Door and advanced gadgets to enter the real Zanshara. There, he discovered that the Time Machine Ticket
            Nobita carried from the 22nd century glowed with a code that matched ancient Zansharan technology.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            The Guardian, recognizing this "future signal," finally understood that Nobita wasn’t a god—but he was
            still important.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Guardian entrusted him with a golden tablet—a hidden record of Zanshara’s complete
            history, lost for thousands of years. The storm passed, the crisis was over, and Nobita and Doraemon
            returned safely to the present. Using the tablet, Nobita submitted the best history project in class.
            For once, even his teacher was impressed.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Though he started the journey just to escape schoolwork,
            Nobita ended up learning more than any textbook could teach. As he lay in bed that night, he looked
            at the stars and wondered if he’d go on another adventure like that.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Doraemon, as always, just smiled
            and said, “Anything’s possible—but do your homework first next time.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;” And with that, another magical
            chapter in Nobita’s life with Doraemon came to an end, full of fun, fear, courage, and unforgettable memories.
